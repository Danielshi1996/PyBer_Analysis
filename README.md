## Summary

The disparity among city types shows that ride count, fare and driver count are directly related to the popultation density. In urban cities, there is a higher demand for PyBer ride share, which result in higher ride count. The average fare shows that urban ride usually has a shorter distance comparing to rural cities. However, there is also a potential issue for the current supply demand situtation. In urban cities supply is greater than demand, the total driver count is greater than ride count. which resulted in significant less average fare per driver. Meaning drivers in urban cities earn less, and a large portion of the drivers in urban cities have not completed a ride in this period of time, more than 4 months.

Thus, the recommendations are:

- Balance the supply and demand in urban cities, either expand customer base or decrease the supply at urban cities
-
